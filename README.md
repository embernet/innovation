# Innovation

I have always worked at the leading edge of technologies as that is what has interested me. Pushing forward into the unknown, creating the future, discovering new ways to think about things and achieve things is tantelising.

Most of my work has been for private companies but there have been a few publications out of that, and a lot more research, which I will gradually start to share here.

I started writing code, loving the algorithmics of it; performance tuning, optimising, fiding clever ways to do things. I soon found out, from my first manager, that people who were asking for new business applications didn't necessarily want rocket ships or racing cars or polymorphic transforming self healing automata.

That's when I started drifting upwards from code into design, requirements, system architecture, enterprise architecture, and ultimately strategy, transformation and innovation.

I always wondered where it would end up; what would be next; the truth is, this is up for grabs, open to interpretation, a game of thrones, or perspectives and ideas and ideals at least.

Innovation, as vague and meaningless as that term is, which holds different truths and balances for different people and organisations, seems like the confluence of problems and solutions and thought and action and even emotion and will and motive.

As we increasingly move further into a world that once was only to be found in sci-fi novels, sharing more seems important.

# Publications

- **[Measuring Innovation](publications/measuring_innovation.pdf)** A paper exploring what innovation is, what it means to different people in different contexts, and different ways to measure it depending on your priorities and motivations. It explores the different phases of innovation, what it takes to innovate in terms of commitment, time, and resources, and provides examples from industry of leading practices, tools, and methodologies.
- **[Connected Car Ecosystem](publications/connected_car_ecosystem.pdf)** A paper about the future of automotive exploring ways participants in the ecosystem can work together to enable self-driving cars. This paper includes research on topics as esoteric as the number of lines of code in the space shuttle, an F35 Fighter-Jet, the Large Hadron Collider, and 'modern connected cars', although when I wrote this the cars were not self-driving - but they still had more lines of code inside them than those other platforms I just listed put together. Maybe AI can help us use less lines of code.
